# AAMOS-00-Starter

Code to support the analysis of the [AAMOS-00 anonymised dataset](https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/3775).

You can find further details about this dataset in the publication "Home Monitoring with Connected Mobile Devices for Asthma Attack Prediction with Machine Learning".


## AAMOS-00 Study 

We carried out the 2-phase, 7-month AAMOS-00 observational study to collect data about asthma status using three smart-monitoring devices (smart peak flow meter, smart inhaler, smartwatch), and daily symptom questionnaires. Combined with localised weather, pollen, and air-quality reports, we collected a rich longitudinal dataset to explore the feasibility of passive monitoring and asthma attack prediction.

Between June-2021 and June-2022, in the midst of UKâ€™s Covid-19 lockdowns, 22 participants across the UK provided 2,054 unique patient-days of data in phase 2 of the AAMOS-00 Study.

## This Repository

The `sci_data_AAMOS-00_start_up.R` file can be used to get started this dataset, it includes joining data tables, data wrangling, and an example binary classification problem.

The code is used to produce the plots and results presented in the "Technical Validation" of our Scientific Data paper.
